# react-app-playground

[![Greenkeeper badge](https://badges.greenkeeper.io/claireparker/react-app-playground.svg)](https://greenkeeper.io/)

This is a trivial app built using `create-react-app` that I can use to faff around with React.

I've also added Greenkeeper to it in order to keep up-to-date with the latest releases - but this means it has to be public instead of private.

Therefore don't judge the code too much - it does what it says on the tin and is a playground for me.
